                    <span> Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern country, emerging as one of the world's first 
                    nation states. Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest
                    developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government </span>
                </div> 
                <p>in ancient Egyptian history, the Old Kingdom is the period spanning c. 2700-2200 BC.</p>
                <span> It is also known as the "Age of the Pyramids" or the "Age of the Pyramid Builders", as it encompasses the reigns of the great 
                    pyramid-builders of the Fourth Dynasty, such as King Sneferu, who perfected the art of pyramid-building, and the kings Khufu, 
                    Khafre and Menkaure, who constructed the pyramids at Giza. Egypt attained its first sustained peak of civilization during 
                    the Old Kingdom, the first of three so-called "Kingdom" periods (followed by the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom), which mark 
                    the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley.</span>

                <p> Egyptians in this era believed the king to be the incarnation of Horus, linking the human and spiritual worlds.</p>
                <span> During Old Kingdom, Horus - previously venerated as the God of war and hunting, and skies, over previous centuries became the symbol of 
                    reigning, maintaining order, as well as social hierarchy. Egyptian views on the nature of time during this period held that the universe 
                    worked in cycles, and the Pharaoh on earth worked to ensure the stability of those cycles. They also perceived themselves as specially
                    selected people. Such understand of the source of power provided the pharaons of that era to enforce great projects, centralise administration
                    , as well as, keep interneal stability (as long as the ruler was alive)</span>

                <h2 id="What_happens_after_death?">What happens after death?</h2>
                <p>Egyptian burial customs came from their conviction that the body and the soul are still connected after death</p>
                <h3>The final(?) path</h3>
                <span>There were many requirements for an egyptian to achieve ideal afterlife. Each soul, after death, would need to traverse the underworld,
                    also known as the duat, The initial image a soul would be presented with upon entering this realm was a corridor lined with an array of fascinating statues, 
                    including a variation of the hawk-headed god, Horus. The path taken to the underworld may have varied between kings and common people. 
                    After entry, spirits were presented to another prominent god, Osiris. Osiris would determine the virtue of the deceased's soul and grant 
                    those deemed deserving a peaceful afterlife. The Egyptian concept of 'eternal life' was often seen as being reborn indefinitely. 
                    Therefore, the souls who had lived their life elegantly were guided to Osiris to be born again.</span>
                <h3>Soul and body</h3>
                <div class="ciekawostka">
                    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
                    <span> Out of all internal organs, the brain was considered useless, and was disposed of instead of being put in separate urns like the rest.</span>
                </div>
                <span>Egyptians believed that the body needed to be preserved in order for the dead to be reborn in the afterlife.
                    Initially, Egyptians thought that like Ra, their physical bodies, or Khat, would reawaken after they completed their journey through 
                    the underworld. Once the Egyptians realized that the bodies of their dead would eventually decay, they started to see the remains 
                    of the dead as a vessel for the deceased's spirit. The body was dismembered and wrapped in bandages to safeguard it, if the soul decided 
                    to return.</span>

                <h2 id="The_pyramids"> The pyramids </h2>
                <p> As egyptian burial customs evolved, the wealthier and more influential people sought to better their final restplace</p>
                <h3>The first burial structures</h3>
                <span> Despite the development of burial architecture, most people were not wealthy or influential enough to provide themselves with 
                    much more than sand burial. Sand is, however, a great natural way to mumify reamins, therefore it served its purpose well .
                    Before the third dynasty started to reign, kings and other influential men were built big rectangular structures made of stone, called mastabas.
                    However, the remains theselves were buried deep beneath the building, in a special underground chamber. </span>
                <h3>The step-pyramids</h3>
                <span> The begining of third dynasty in Egypt marks the start of Step pyramids building. The first one ever, built during the reign of pharaoh Djoser, 
                    was probably meant to be a big mastaba at first. Yet, as the construction continued, more and more additional features were implemented, leading to
                    what we know now as Pyramid of Djoser. The new standards proved to be hard to keep up with, since, after the original step pyramid, the next three 
                    major structures of that type did not stand the test of time. Nevertheless, Many small step pyramids were built in decades to come.</span>
                 <div class="ciekawostka">
                    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
                    <span> Ancient Egypt was already considered ancient by the Romans - Julius Ceasar's rule was closer to our times than to the times of first pyramids. Makes you think how ancient these structures really are!  </span>
                </div> 
                <h3>True pyramids</h3>
                <span>The fourth dynasty was started by a rather ambitious ruler, Pharaoh Sneferu. It was under his rule that the first three "true" pyramids were constructed.
                    Why three? Well... due to their experimental nature the first two attempts were not successful. Thanks to the knowledge gained from previous ones, the third
                    pyramid set even higher standards for future generations to come.</span>

                <p>To this day, there are many myths and misunderstandings around the proccess of buidling the ancient tombs</p>
                <h3>Slaves, workers, and aliens</h3>
                <div class="ciekawostka">
                    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
                    <span> People believed that slaves built the pyramids even in ancient times. the ancient Greek historian, Herodotus specifies that the pyramids were built with slave labor – 100,000 slaves, to be exact.
                        Keep in mind he wrote that 2000 years after they were built!
                    </span>
                </div>
                <span>
                Because of popular media, it is often believed that the pyramids were built by slaves. That couldn't be further from truth.
                The people who were working on these builiding sites were generously paid. What's more, entire settlements of craftsmen,
                architects and their families were erected during the years it took to finish such structures. The physical workers were farmers
                who only worked off-season, when their crops didn't require tending to. Any fatal casulties during construction were rare, 
                and families of the deceased were generously compensated for their loss. All workers, additionally, were given a place 
                in one of the smaller tombs made next to the main structure, essentially granting them a dignified burial next to the pharaoh</span>
                <h3>Platforms, water, and animals</h3>
                <span>
                The question arises, how could such great blocks of stone be stacked at top of eachother, while also being so perfectly lined up?
                Well, for the first part, the blocks were moved using a sleighlike vehicle, which was pulled on previously watered sand along the river.
                it was pulled by either humans or animals, most likely both, which contrary to common beliefs, is no an impossible feat with enough muscle
                pulling the weight (also taking into acoount how little dynamic friction watered sand offers). wide platforms at low angles were erected in order 
                to stack blocks on top of eachother .Now, about perfectly cut blocks... they weren't.It is actually a common misconception - the outer blocks were well cut, 
                yet by no means were they perfectly lined up. The blocks inside, however,were far cruder and rougher, since they weren't supposed to be seen at all.
                </span>
                <h3>Decentralization of power</h3>
                <span> it is actually due to the pyramids, and their enormous cost, that led to decetralization of power during the Old Kingdom.
                    as local bureaucrats wealth increased, so did their influence, which in the end led to the first intermediate Period,
                    which was well over a century of chaos and struggle for power. After that, the Pyramids were never the same - their number increased,
                    since local nobles could afford them, yet they were never quite as big as during the Old Kingdom.
